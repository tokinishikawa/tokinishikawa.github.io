                    <h1>Toki Nishikawa</h1>
                    <p>My name is Toki Nishikawa, and I graduated from Tufts University in May 2023 with a BS in Engineering Physics. I studied physics because Iâ€™m burning with curiosity about the world around me. From the infinitesimal structures of particle physics to the seemingly boundless abyss of space, the phenomena that define our existence never cease to amaze me. I'm especially facsinated by the brain, particularly the mystery behind consciousness.</p>
                    <p>My interest in mechanical engineering grew as I learned more about the relevant opportunities at Tufts. Electrosystems and Robotics I, taught by Brandon Stafford and Briana Bouchard, was one of my most rewarding academic pursuits. Sometimes physics is frustrating because most of what you learn is theory, and the physical consequences are not always obvious. On the other hand, this course was quite the opposite. We learned by developing prototypes, evaluating them, and then fixing them as needed. A lot more fun.</p>
