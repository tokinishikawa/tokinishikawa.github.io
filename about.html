                    <h1>Toki Nishikawa</h1>
                    <p>Hi, I’m Toki. I graduated from Tufts University in May 2023 with a BS in Engineering Physics. I chose to study physics because I’m burning with curiosity about the world around me. From the infinitesimal structures of particle physics to the seemingly boundless abyss of space, the phenomena that define our existence never cease to amaze me. I’m especially fascinated by the brain and the mystery behind consciousness.</p>
                    <p>In my junior year, I worked with the Tufts ATLAS group where I was primarily tasked with optimizing computational methods of binned maximum likelihood fitting in PyTorch using neural networks. I authored a paper detailing binned maximum likelihood theory and PyTorch applications which can be found on the <i>Physics</i> tab underneath <i>Physics Papers</i>. I’ve also worked as a TA for the introductory electricity and magnetism course at Tufts where I guided students through course material and homework problems during my personal office hours. Additionally, I vetted exam questions to evaluate exam difficulty and length.</p>
                    <p>My interest in mechanical engineering grew as I learned more about the relevant opportunities at Tufts. There are many project-based courses in this department that have provided me with some of my most rewarding academic pursuits. Sometimes physics is frustrating because it’s mainly theory, and the physical consequences are not always obvious. On the other hand, in these engineering courses, we learn by developing prototypes, evaluating them, and then fixing them as needed, which can be a lot more exciting.</p>
