                    <h1>Project Description</h1>
                    <p>My partner and I designed and constructed a gravity-powered record player. A notable challenge was calculating the optimal gear ratio, enabling the record player to spin for the duration of the song while requiring minimal vertical descent of the weight. We ultimately selected a 20:1 ratio, signifying that each revolution of the smaller cylinder corresponded to 20 revolutions of the record.</p>
                    <p>Another obstacle pertained to ensuring a consistent rotational speed, thereby necessitating the introduction of friction to counterbalance the acceleration due to gravity. Calculating the precise amount of theoretical friction needed seemed a formidable task, prompting us to devise an adjustable friction system. As depicted in the photo on the right, our solution incorporated acrylic sheets flanking the wheel, enabling us to apply pressure and augment friction within the system as required.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, our design featured a timing belt, effectively eliminating slippage and ensuring the accurate implementation of our chosen gear ratio. The adjustability of the position of the wheel allowed us to manipulate the tension of the timing belt.</p>
