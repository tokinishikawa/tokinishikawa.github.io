                        <h1>Project Description</h1>
                        <p>My team and I designed and manufactured a meticulously engineered lifting machine with the objective of hoisting a 12-cubic-foot box onto a 30-inch platform situated 12 feet away. Our solution comprised an array of integrated components, including a crank mechanism, a self-tightening clamp, and an I-beam, which effectively facilitated the adjustment of torque by altering the distance between the crane and the box. </p>
                        <p>This project prompted me to learn and master various new tools. With the lathe, we cut and shaped the aluminum rods that constituted the crank mechanism as well as the structural foundation of the crane itself. We tapped each of these rods to secure them to their related components. Using the water jet, we shaped the sheet of metal in the crank which increased the gear ratio. In addition, this project allowed me to further familiarize myself with various essential woodworking tools, such as the mitre saw, table saw, band saw, and drill press.</p>
